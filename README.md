# Exploratory Data Analysis on E-Commerce Data
## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world Brazilian e-commerce dataset (Olist) to understand data quality, customer behavior, sales trends, and operational patterns.
The goal is to extract actionable business insights and highlight potential areas for improvement before any modeling or downstream analytics.

EDA is a critical step in the data lifecycle, and this project focuses on building a strong analytical foundation through structured exploration and interpretation of real-world data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset comes from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small businesses to customers through online marketplaces.

It contains multiple relational tables covering:
- Customers
- Orders
- Order items
- Products
- Payments
- Reviews

*Each table represents a different aspect of the e-commerce workflow, allowing for rich, multi-dimensional analysis.*

## Objectives

The key objectives of this analysis are:
- Assess data quality and identify missing or inconsistent values
- Understand customer purchasing behavior
- Analyze product and category-level performance
- Explore pricing, freight costs, and delivery patterns
- Examine review scores and customer satisfaction
- Identify time-based trends in orders and revenue

## Key Questions Explored
- Are there significant data quality issues that could impact analysis?
- How are order prices and freight values distributed?
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?
- How do delivery delays relate to customer review scores?
- What payment methods are most commonly used?
- How do orders and revenue change over time?
- Are customers repeat buyers or primarily one-time purchasers?

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy – data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – visualization
- Jupyter Notebook
